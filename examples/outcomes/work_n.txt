# You may need a visa to work or do business in the UK

Whether you need a visa depends on your circumstances.

## Business visits

You don't need a visa if you're coming to the UK for activities allowed under the following visas:

- a [business visitor](/business-visitor-visa)
- a [sports visitor](/sports-visit-visa)
- an [entertainer](/entertainer-visitor-visa)
- a [prospective entrepreneur](https://www.gov.uk/prospective-entrepreneur)
- a visitor doing a ['permitted paid engagement'](/permitted-paid-engagement-visa) (you must have been invited to the UK because of your expertise) - you can only stay for up to 1 month

However, you should bring [supporting documents](/government/publications/visitor-visa-guide-to-supporting-documents) to show at the border.

%You may want to [apply for a visa](/browse/visas-immigration/short-visit-visas) if you have a criminal record or you’ve previously been refused entry into the UK.%

^ You won't need a visa for [qualifying work](/tier-5-temporary-worker-creative-and-sporting-visa/overview) in sports, arts or entertainment if you're coming to the UK for less than 3 months.
