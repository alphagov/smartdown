# You’ll need a visa to pass through the UK in transit

You should apply for a [Visitor in Transit visa](/transit-visa) if you arrive on a flight and will pass through immigration control before you leave the UK.

##Transiting without a visa

You might be eligible for the ‘transit without visa concession’ if:

- you arrive and depart by air
- have a confirmed onward flight which leaves within 24 hours
- have the right documents for your destination (eg a visa for that country)

One of the following must also apply:

- you’re travelling to Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country
- you’re travelling from Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and it’s less than 6 months since you last entered that country with a valid entry visa
- you have a valid US permanent residence card issued on or after 21 April 1998 (or an I-797 extension letter issued by the Bureau of Citizenship if it’s expired)
- you have a valid Canadian permanent resident card issued on or after 28 June 2002
- you have a valid uniform format category D visa for entry to a state in the European Economic Area (EEA)
- you have a valid uniform format residence permit issued by an EEA state

%The ‘transit without visa concession’ is decided by the immigration officer at the border. You won’t be allowed to transit if they decide you need a visa, so you might want to apply for a transit visa before you travel.%
