# You’ll need a visa to pass through the UK in transit

You should apply for a [Visitor in Transit visa](/transit-visa) if you arrive on a flight and will pass through immigration control before you leave the UK.

##Transiting without a visa
You might be eligible for the ‘transit without visa concession’ if:

-  you arrive and depart by air
-  have a confirmed onward flight which leaves within 24 hours
-  have the correct documents for your destination (eg a visa for that country)

%The ‘transit without visa concession’ is decided by the immigration officer at the border. You won’t be allowed to transit if they decide you need a visa, so you might want to apply for a transit visa before you travel.%
