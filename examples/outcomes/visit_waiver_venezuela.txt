# You won’t need a visa if you have an ePassport

However, you should bring the [same documents](/government/publications/visitor-visa-guide-to-supporting-documents) you'd need to apply for a visa, to show to officers at the UK border.

^If you don’t have an ePassport, you must [apply for a transit visa](/transit-visa).^[^leaving_airport?]

^If you don't have an ePassport, you should apply for a [Direct Airside Transit Visa](/transit-visa/direct-airside-transit-visa) unless you're exempt.^[^not_leaving_airport?]

##Transiting without a visa[^leaving_airport?]

You might be eligible for the 'transit without a visa concession' if you don't have an ePassport, so long as:

- you arrive and depart by air

- have a confirmed onward flight which leaves within 24 hours

- have the right documents for your destination (eg a visa for that country)

One of the following must also apply:

- you’re travelling to Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country

- you’re travelling from Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and it’s less than 6 months since you last entered that country with a valid entry visa

- you have a valid US permanent residence card issued on or after 21 April 1998 (or an I-797 extension letter issued by the Bureau of Citizenship if it’s expired)

- you have a valid Canadian permanent resident card issued on or after 28 June 2002

- you have a valid uniform format category D visa for entry to a state in the European Economic Area (EEA)

- you have a valid uniform format residence permit issued by an EEA state

%The ‘transit without visa concession’ is decided by the immigration officer at the border. You won’t be allowed to transit if they decide you need a visa, so you might want to apply for a transit visa before you travel.%

##Exemptions[^not_leaving_airport?]

You won't need a visa if you:

- are travelling to Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country
- are travelling from Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and it’s less than 6 months since you last entered that country with a valid entry visa
- have a valid US permanent residence card issued on or after 21 April 1998 (or an I-797 extension letter issued by the Bureau of Citizenship if it’s expired)
- have a valid Canadian permanent resident card issued on or after 28 June 2002
- have a valid uniform format category D visa for entry to a state in the European Economic Area (EEA)
