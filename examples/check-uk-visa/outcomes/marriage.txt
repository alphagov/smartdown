# You’ll need a visa to come to the UK

See the [marriage visit visa category](/marriage-visa) for eligibility and
documents you need to provide if you and your partner are from outside the
European Economic Area (EEA) and you don't plan to stay in the UK longer than
6 months.

If you’re getting married to a British citizen or someone settled in the UK
and you plan to stay longer than 6 months, see the [joining settled family
](/remain-in-uk-family) guide.
