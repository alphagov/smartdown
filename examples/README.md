# Smartdown examples

These are intended as simple examples of how Smartdown looks and works flows are
structured, and how they use the various features of Smartdown.

They should be kept up to date as new features are added, but the best examples
will be the real content in
 the [Smart Answers application](https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/tree/master/lib/smartdown_flows).
